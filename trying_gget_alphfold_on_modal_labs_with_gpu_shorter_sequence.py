# ## Basic setup

import os
import tempfile

import modal
import modal.image

# ## Defining the image
#
# gget requires a very custom image in order to run properly.
# In order to save you some time, we have precompiled the Python packages
# and stored them in a Dockerhub image.

#Need  equivalent of `conda install -c conda-forge openmm=7.5.1`
the_commands = [
    "conda install -c conda-forge openmm=7.5.1 --yes",
    "pip install gget",
]
stub = modal.Stub(image=modal.Conda().conda_install(["git"]).run_commands(the_commands))


# ## Setting things up in the containers
#
# We need various global configuration that we want to happen inside the containers (but not locally), such as
# enabling the GPU device.
# To do this, we use the `stub.is_inside()` conditional, which will evaluate to `False` when the script runs
# locally, but to `True` when imported in the cloud.

if stub.is_inside():
    import gget
    gget.setup("alphafold")



# ## Use a GPU from a Modal function
#
# Now, let's define the function that renders each frame in parallel.
# Note the `gpu=True` argument which tells Modal to use GPU workers.

    # Just wanted a short sequence in hopes could test how to get back results 
    # without huge wait to test. However, had to lengthen as when I ran

    # minimum is 16` So switched to 16 amino acid peptide (696â€“777 of the human 
    # a2-macroglobulin) from
